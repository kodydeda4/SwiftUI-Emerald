### b. Description

#### i. Product Description

YabaiUI  - A GUI for configuring Yabai and SKHD.

* Yabai is a `tiling window manager`
* SKHD is a `hotkey daemon`
****
When used together, these programs give macOS users the ability to:

* Toggle between layouts (floating and bsp)
* Focus and move windows using key commands
* Force certain apps to 'always float on top'
* etc.

Yabai and SKHD are both open source projects created by `koekeishiya` on Github.  
A link to his page can be found [here](https://github.com/koekeishiya).  

> You can find more information about **Yabai**  [here](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki).  
> You can find more information about **SKHD** [here](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd).

### ii. Why do it?

Yabai and SKHD are both powerful, feature-rich programs.  
However, they lack a unified GUI, which makes them difficult to understand, configure, or use.

To get started, a new user has to:

 1. Read the [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki)  documentation.
 2. Read the [SKHD](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)  documentation.
 3. Manually write  preferences to the following files using a text-editor:

    `~/.yabairc`  
    `~/.skhdrc`

We feel that the macOS system deserves a more polished user experience.

### iii. What will it accomplish?

It will bring tiling window managers capabilites to a broader audience, by making them more user-friendly and accessible.
