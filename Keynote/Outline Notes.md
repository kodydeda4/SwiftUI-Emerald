# Presentation Outline NOTES

Notes

**Tell a story**

- Breif Rundown
- Body of presentation
- Tell you what they just told them

helps reinforce the points at least 3 times

Graphs?

Repitions is your friend - allows you to build ideas and remember key points and be memorable.

Be authentic - lets you be relatable! be someone the audience can relate to or feel comfortable talking to.
Helps them mentally engage.
Workout hard before doing the presentation so that you're relaxed.

Practice the presentation so you can sound natural, authentic, confident, relaxed.

## 1. Introduction

## 1.1  What is a TWM?

* Show them what a tiling window manager is through examples
* Touch on Yabai

## 1.2 TWM Problems

Explain how they are normally configured and why this is annoying

People have a hard time figuring out how to use them, even for the basics.

I wanted to make a program that was way , and super easy to use. That is why I created Emerald.

The main problem is that they're not so easy to use,
You have to install the program through the command-line
You have to read through documentation
And you have to configure two seperate programs, the first is for the actual tiling window manager, and the second is for skhd, a program that configures keyboard shortcuts.  To configure these programs, you have to read through documentation on Github, and type up your preferences into a file hidden on your desktop called a `dotfile`.  This means that a lot of the options and capability for the program can never actually be realized.  Show examples.


------------

The problem with these programs is that they aren't very easy to use.

### 1. Getting Started

To even get started using a tiling window manager, you have to install the program through the terminal.  

For programmers like us, that might be easy, but for most users that comes across as really difficult.

It sends a lot of people away before they ever start using it because they can't understand what it's supposed to do in the first place, and even if they did, it would seem overly complicated or difficult to install a program through the terminal.

To make things even more complicated, some tiling window managers DO NOT come with built in way of adding shortcuts.  Yabai is like this, it actually relies on a completely seperate program to configure keyboard shortcuts, which is also installed and configured via the terminal.


### 2. Configuration

To configure these programs, you have to read through documentation, and be somewhat familiar with a programming language.

DWM is written & configured in C
XMonad is written & configured in Haskell
Awesome is written & configured in Lua
etc etc 

In the case of Yabai, the configuration is just written in plaintext as a series of terminal commands.

### 3. Extensibility



I wanted to make a program that was way , and super easy to use. That is why I created Emerald.

## Notes

Presentation next Thursday

Send him the slides next Wednesday

Presentations from 11:00 - 1:00

Stick around to see everybody elses

- Have a script (outline)
- assume nobody knows what ur talking about
- aim for 15 minutes
- don’t blow through it either
- Talk about the technologies BEFORE you switch into the demo
- As you’re going through the demo, DO NOT TALK about implementation (unless it’s a really short comment)
- Spend a little bit longer on each step, they’re going to be trying to take in everything that they’re seeing
- After the demo, 3 things you learned
  
  - 1. Swift is a cool language etc
  - 2. Trying to work with other peoples programs was complicated
  - 3. TCA Architecture
- What are my plans for this?
- For the demo, go through it out-loud alone 2 or 3 times so you can figure out what you’re missing
- Add your GitHub or LinkedIn or something

1. slides before
2. live demo
3. slides after

No schedule
