# Presentation Outline

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Explain the problem - Floating Window Managers

Show the problems with floating window managers.

1. Windows can get messy
2. Most of the time you're just snapping one on the left, one on the right.
   _When you do this you can't see your wallpaper_

3. Inefficient use of screen realestate
4. Having to move and resize windows with your mouse.

### 1.2 Explain the solution - Tiling Window Managers

Explain a possible solution - Tiling Window Managers.
Show pictures

### 1.3 The problem with Tiling Window Managers

Explain the problems with Tiling Window Managers
use as a segway into demo - "That's why I decided to create what i'm about to show you."

## 2. Live Demo

Live demo of Emerald

- **show live keyboard shortcuts**
- set the logo as your wallpaper.
- show it off using spotlight search
- write a list of things you want to show off here:
  1. toggle between floating, tiling, and stacking modes.
  2. toggle gaps/padding
  3. focus, resize, swap
  4. how it plays with other keyboard shortcuts (spotlight search, cmd H, cmd M, cmd Q, cmd TAB, option + arrowkeys for text, cmd+ arrowkeys for text)
  5. Mouse follows focus
  6. Transparency
  7. Always on top
  8. Shadows

## 3. Explain what you built and how you created it

Explain how you wanted to make something simple and easy to use

### 3.1 SwiftUI

### 3.2 TCA

### 3.3 Functional Programming

## 4. Recap

### 3 things you learned from building this project

Recap with 3 things you learned, future plans for the project (webflow etc), links & references for people interested in learning about SwiftUI

1. Plan - why i'm glad I didn't, learning from failures, why i will be planning from now on.
 Planning gives you a direction, talk about how you struggled to create a simple - architecture that was actually what you naturally intended it to be from the start lol xD

2. Functional Programming - value vs mutation, closures, view modifiers, capabilities, plug PointFree

3.  

### Future plans

show other projects
release version 1 with an associated WebFlow site

### Resources

- PointFree
- PaulHudson
- Swift documentation
- Github links to Yabai & SKHD.

### Exit

Exit with profile pic & links to Github, LinkedIn, etc.

<!-- ## 1. Introduction

## 1.1  What is a TWM?

* Show them what a tiling window manager is through examples

## 1.2 TWM Problems

### 1. Getting Started

To even get started using a tiling window manager, you have to install the program through the terminal.  

For programmers like us, that might be easy, but for most users that comes across as really difficult.

It sends a lot of people away before they ever start using it because they can't understand what it's supposed to do in the first place, and even if they did, it would seem overly complicated or difficult to install a program through the terminal.

To make things even more complicated, some tiling window managers DO NOT come with built in way of adding shortcuts.  Yabai is like this, it actually relies on a completely seperate program to configure keyboard shortcuts, which is also installed and configured via the terminal.


### 2. Configuration

To configure these programs, you have to read through documentation, and be somewhat familiar with a programming language.

DWM is written & configured in C
XMonad is written & configured in Haskell
Awesome is written & configured in Lua
etc etc 

In the case of Yabai, the configuration is just written in plaintext as a series of terminal commands.

### 3. Extensibility



I wanted to make a program that was way , and super easy to use. That is why I created Emerald.

### Random

Explain how they are normally configured and why this is annoying

People have a hard time figuring out how to use them, even for the basics.

I wanted to make a program that was way , and super easy to use. That is why I created Emerald.

The main problem is that they're not so easy to use,
You have to install the program through the command-line
You have to read through documentation
And you have to configure two seperate programs, the first is for the actual tiling window manager, and the second is for skhd, a program that configures keyboard shortcuts.  To configure these programs, you have to read through documentation on Github, and type up your preferences into a file hidden on your desktop called a `dotfile`.  This means that a lot of the options and capability for the program can never actually be realized.  Show examples.

The problem with these programs is that they aren't very easy to use. -->
