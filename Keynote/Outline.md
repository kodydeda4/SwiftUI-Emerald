Presentations from 11:00 - 1:00

Stick around to see everybody elses

- Have a script (outline)
- assume nobody knows what ur talking about
- aim for 15 minutes
- don’t blow through it either
- Talk about the technologies BEFORE you switch into the demo
- As you’re going through the demo, DO NOT TALK about implementation (unless it’s a really short comment)
- Spend a little bit longer on each step, they’re going to be trying to take in everything that they’re seeing
- After the demo, 3 things you learned
  
  - 1. Swift is a cool language etc
  - 2. Trying to work with other peoples programs was complicated
  - 3. TCA Architecture
- What are my plans for this?
- For the demo, go through it out-loud alone 2 or 3 times so you can figure out what you’re missing
- Add your GitHub or LinkedIn or something
